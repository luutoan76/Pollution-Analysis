# 🌍 Pollution Analysis (World & Vietnam)

This project focuses on analyzing air pollution data worldwide and in Viet Nam.  
The goal is to explore trends, causes, and impacts of different pollutants, and to provide meaningful insights through data analysis and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Collect and preprocess air pollution datasets from 2 different sources.  
- Understand pollution trends across time and regions.
- Compare Viet Nam average pollution with global average.
- Explore relationships between pollutants (PM2.5, NO₂, Ozone, CO).  
- Provide visual insights that can support awareness and policy-making.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Remove duplicates and missing records.  
- Handle missing countries values by filling country base on cities name.  
- Convert date/time columns into proper formats.  
- Normalize pollutant names and measurement units.  

---

## 🔎 Data Understanding
- Explore dataset dimensions, data types, and summary statistics.  
- Identify the main pollutants: PM2.5, NO₂, Ozone, CO.
- Analyze pollutant distributions and correlations.  
- Compare Vietnam’s avergae pollution levels with global average.

## 📊 Data Visualization
- **Lines plots**: Pollution trends by year.
- **Bar charts**: Country/region comparisons.  
- **Heatmaps**: Correlation between pollutants.  
- **Geospatial map**: Pollution distribution across locations.
- **Scatter Plot**: Compare the correlation between pollutant

## ✅ Conclusion
- Air pollution remains a global issue with significant regional differences.  
- In Vietnam, the major pollution issues are caused by **PM2.5** and **Ozone (O₃)**.
- The top 10 most polluted countries are primarily located in Asia and Africa. 
- PM2.5 is identified as the most critical factor determining overall air quality.
